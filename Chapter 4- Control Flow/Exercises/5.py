#To make a list I used brackets and list them.

# I used a 'for' loop to iterate over each fruit in the list.
for f in favorite_fruits:
    # I used 'if' statements to print a personalized message for each favorite fruit.
    if f == 'apples':
        print('You really like apples!')
    if f == 'oranges':
        print('You really like oranges!')
    if f == 'mangoes':
        print('You really like mangos!')
    if f == 'bananas':
        print('You really like bananas!')
    if f == 'grapes':
        print('You really like grapes!')

# I used 'for' to simplify the process of iterating through the list and printing personalized messages.
