#I used "a" as a variable that holds 'hello' as its value

a= 'hello'

#I wrote a statement to print 'a' which is hello
print(a)

#I changed the variable 'a' value into 'hi'
a= 'hi'

#since I changed the value of the variable 'a' into "hi" more recently the program will print "hi" instead of "hello"
print(a)
