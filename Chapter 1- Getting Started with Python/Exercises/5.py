r = float(input('Enter radius of a circle:'))

#since the formula to get the area of a circle is Ï€r^2 I made a variable called answer
#I multiplied 3.14(pi) to the r which is inputted by the user and multiplies it again to r to get the final answer
answer = 3.14*r*r

#Prints final answer
print('The area of the circle is:', answer)
