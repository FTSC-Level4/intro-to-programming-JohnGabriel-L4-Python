#I created a list 'Guests
Guests= ['Grandpa','Grandma','Uncle']

# I used a 'for' loop to iterate over each guest in the list
# During each iteration, the variable 'g' holds the current guest's name
for g in Guests:
    print(f'I am inviting you to come join me for dinner',(g))

#Then printed the invitation
